}
\arguments{
\item{INPUT}{A list object with the elements of 't', 'y', 'w', 'Tn' (option)
and 'ylu', returned by \code{check_input}.}

\item{nptperyear}{Integer, points per year.}

\item{south}{Boolean. In south hemisphere, growing year is 1 July to the
following year 31 June; In north hemisphere, growing year is 1 Jan to 31 Dec.}

\item{FUN}{Coarse curve fitting function, can be one of `sgfitw`, `whitsmw2`
and `wHANTS`.}

\item{wFUN}{weights updating function, can be one of 'wTSM', 'wChen' and
'wBisquare'.}

\item{iters}{How many times curve fitting is implemented.}

\item{wmin}{Double, minimum weigth (i.e. weight of snow, ice and cloud).}

\item{lambda}{the parameter of \code{whitsmw2}}

\item{nf}{the parameter of \code{wHANTS}, number of frequencies to be
considered above the zero frequency}

\item{frame}{the parameter of \code{sgfitw}, moving window size. Suggested by
TIMESAT, default frame = floor(nptperyear/7)*2 + 1.}

\item{minpeakdistance}{The minimum distance (in indices) peaks have to have
to be counted. If the distance of two maximum extreme value less than
`minpeakdistance`, only the real maximum value will be left.}

\item{threshold_max}{Similar as `threshold_min`, The maximum threshold should
be greater than `threshold_max`.}

\item{threshold_min}{Threshold is defined as the difference of peak value with
trough value. There are two threshold (left and right). The minimum threshold
should be greater than threshold_min.}

\item{ypeak_min}{ypeak >= ypeak_min}

\item{rytrough_max}{ytrough <= rytrough_max*A, A is the amplitude of y.}

\item{MaxPeaksPerYear}{This parameter is used to adjust lambda in iterations.
If PeaksPerYear > MaxPeaksPerYear, then lambda = lambda*2.}

\item{MaxTroughsPerYear}{This parameter is used to adjust lambda in iterations.
If TroughsPerYear > MaxTroughsPerYear, then lambda = lambda*2.}

\item{IsPlot}{Boolean}

\item{plotdat}{A list or data.table, with 't', 'y' and 'w'. Only if
IsPlot=true, plotdata will be used to plot. Known that y and w in \code{INPUT}
have been changed, we suggest using the original data.table.}

\item{print}{Whether to print progress information}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to findpeaks}
}
\value{
A list object with the elements of 'fit' and 'dt'.
list(dt, di)
$whit
}
\description{
First smooth VI timeseries by weighted whittaker, then use findpeak function
to get the local maximum and local minimum values. Two local minimum defined
a growing season. If two local minimum(maximum) are too closed, then only the
smaller(biger) is left.
}
\details{
Then according to season pos, based to local maximum position divide yearly
growing season. lambda need to set carefully.
